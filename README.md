# PostQuantumCryptography
### Exploring Quantum Code-Breaking and its Advantages
__Abstract:__ This project delves into the potential of quantum computing for code-breaking,
specifically focusing on its advantages over classical computing methods. We will explore
the limitations of classical algorithms like brute force, which exhibit exponential time
complexity when dealing with complex encryption schemes.

__Focus:__ Our primary focus will be on __post quantum cryptography__ and how classical encryption (Like RSA and ECC) is at a risk due to Quantum computers. We will be exploring what post quantum cryptography does to address this?

### Methodology:
1. __Literature review:__ We will conduct a comprehensive literature review of relevant
research papers and articles to gain a deeper understanding of:
○ Classical code-breaking techniques, including brute force and cryptanalysis.
○ Quantum code-breaking techniques, with a specific emphasis on Shor's
algorithm and its theoretical foundation in quantum mechanics concepts like
superposition and entanglement.

2. __Simulation:__ We will develop a simulated implementation of Shor's algorithm
using a classical programming language like Python or C++. This simulation will:
○ Utilize quantum circuit libraries to represent the quantum operations
involved in Shor's algorithm.
* Simulate the algorithm's execution on a simulated quantum computer.
* Analyze the results to demonstrate the algorithm's ability to factor integers
exponentially faster than classical methods for specific key sizes.

3. __Complexity Analysis:__ We will perform a comparative analysis of the time
complexities of classical and quantum code-breaking algorithms. This analysis will
highlight the exponential speedup offered by Shor's algorithm, emphasizing the
significant advantage it holds over classical approaches for factoring large numbers.

__Expected Outcomes:__
* Gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of classical and
quantum code-breaking algorithms.
* Demonstrate the computational advantage of Shor's algorithm over classical
methods through a simulated implementation and complexity analysis.
* Raise awareness of the urgency for developing and implementing post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) to mitigate the threat of quantum attacks on existing encryption
schemes.
