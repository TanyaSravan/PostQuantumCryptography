# PostQuantumCryptography
### Exploring Quantum Code-Breaking and its Advantages
__Abstract:__ The rise of quantum computers poses a significant threat to current public-key cryptography. Shor's algorithm can efficiently break widely used schemes like RSA that rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) emerges as a critical response, offering new algorithms resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.

__Focus:__ Our primary focus will be on __post quantum cryptography__ and how classical encryption (Like RSA and ECC) is at a risk due to Quantum computers. We will be exploring what post quantum cryptography does to address this?

### Methodology:
1. __Literature review:__ We will conduct a comprehensive literature review of relevant
research papers and articles to gain a deeper understanding of:
* Classical code-breaking techniques, including brute force and cryptanalysis.
* Quantum code-breaking techniques, with a specific emphasis on Shor's
algorithm and its theoretical foundation in quantum mechanics concepts like
superposition and entanglement.
* Understand exsisting algoritms that are not broken by quantum cryptography and explore the fundamental properties behind such processes
2. __Implementation:__ We will try to implement algorithms to understand the field of post quantum cryptography which includes:
* Lattice based cryptography techniques like the Crystal-Kyber technique
* Code Based cryptography like McEliece cryptosystem
* Some Multivariate cryptography algorithms
3. __Analysis:__ Final goal is to compare the different fields of cryptography and analyze the benefits to each of them. We seek to propose and explain the various PQC solutions, suggest some improvements to them and demonstrate a limited practical implementation for various use cases.

We seek to explore methods of post-quantum cryptography and report on them. The idea is to compare and contrast other ways of creating np hard problems for quantum computers. Following the report we seek to either propose a possible improvement on one of the lattice or non lattice based techniqueâ€™s algorithms or alternatively pick a novel domain of mathematically complex problems and use them to make a simple encryption algorithm that confirms to standards of post-quantum cryptography, a possible domain that was __chaos modelling__ and __chaos based cryptography__.
